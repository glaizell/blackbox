## Getting Started

To get you up and running, we need to install a few packages. Don't worry, it's super easy!

### What You Need

First things first, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have it yet, you can grab it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installing the Packages

We'll be using `pip` to install everything we need. Just follow these steps:

1. Open up your terminal (or command prompt on Windows).
2. Type in the following commands one by one and hit Enter:

```bash
# Install selenium
pip install selenium

# Install fake-useragent
pip install fake-useragent

# Install webdriver-manager
pip install webdriver-manager

# Install pandas
pip install pandas
